# Python-Resistor-Calculator

The Python-Resistor-Calculator is a program that calculates the resistance of resistors based on the color bands. 
The user can choose the number of bands (4, 5, or 6), and then input the colors for each band.

Key Features
User Input: Allows the user to select 4, 5, or 6-band resistors and input color codes.
Color Validation: Ensures that only valid colors are entered.
Dynamic Calculation:
For 4-band: Calculates resistance with two significant digits, a multiplier, and a tolerance.
For 5-band: Adds a third significant digit.
For 6-band: Includes a temperature coefficient.
